Lab_Curve Fitting

Task 1. 
Given the following polynomial: p(x) = âˆ’5.45x^4 + 3.2x^2 + 8x+ 5.6 find the roots of this equation by using polynomial from library numphy. (p(x)=0  => x=?)

x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y = [15, 10, 9, 6, 2, 0]
For given data

Task 2.  
#  % compute the coefficients
#x_mean
#x_std

#y_mean
#y_std

#x*x=x**2
#x*y
# y*y=y**2
#(y-ymean)**2

Task 3.
Make a curve fitting by using by using linear regression.

Task 4.  
Make a curve fitting by using the models using different orders (2.order, 3.order, 4.order and 5.order) of the polynomial.

Task 5. 

Make a curve fitting by using the NumPy functions polyfit() and polyval for 3rd.order model.
